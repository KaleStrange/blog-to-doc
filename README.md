Make sure you have python installed and all of the import dependancies. You can install dependancies using pip install <dependancy_name>

Copy parser.py to '[your_python_directory]\Lib\site-packages\wpparser\'. For me the directory is: 'C:\Python311\Lib\site-packages\wpparser\'

Add the folders downloaded from using 'Export content' and 'Export Media Library' in wordpress to the 'blog-to-doc' folder. 

You should be able to run docWriter if you have jupyter installed. I'm using VSCode, for which you can install jupyter in the "Extensions" sidebar
